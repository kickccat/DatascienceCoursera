# 1. Take a look at the 'iris' dataset that comes with R. The data can be loaded with the code:
# library(datasets)
# data(iris)
# A description of the dataset can be found by running
# There will be an object called 'iris' in your workspace. In this dataset, what is the mean of 'Sepal.Length' for the species virginica?
tapply(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
    setosa versicolor  virginica 
     5.006      5.936      6.588 
     
# 2.Continuing with the 'iris' dataset from the previous Question, what R code returns a vector of the means of the variables 'Sepal.Length', 'Sepal.Width', 'Petal.Length', and 'Petal.Width'?
apply(iris[, 1:4], 2, mean)
Sepal.Length  Sepal.Width Petal.Length  Petal.Width 
    5.843333     3.057333     3.758000     1.199333 
    
# 3. Load the 'mtcars' dataset in R with the following code
# library(datasets)
# data(mtcars)
# There will be an object names 'mtcars' in your workspace. You can find some information about the dataset by running
# How can one calculate the average miles per gallon (mpg) by number of cylinders in the car (cyl)? Select all that apply.
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, mean)
sapply(split(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl), mean)
with(mtcars, tapply(mpg, cyl, mean))
 4        6        8 
26.66364 19.74286 15.10000 

# 4. Continuing with the 'mtcars' dataset from the previous Question, what is the absolute difference between the average horsepower of 4-cylinder cars and the average horsepower of 8-cylinder cars?
abs(mean(mtcars$hp[mtcars$cyl==4]) - mean(mtcars$hp[mtcars$cyl==8]))
[1] 126.5779
